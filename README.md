#### From RFC 1014:

XDR is a standard for the description and encoding of data.  It is
useful for transferring data between different computer
architectures, and has been used to communicate data between such
diverse machines as the SUN WORKSTATION*, VAX*, IBM-PC*, and Cray*.
XDR fits into the ISO presentation layer, and is roughly analogous in
purpose to X.409, ISO Abstract Syntax Notation.  The major difference
between these two is that XDR uses implicit typing, while X.409 uses
explicit typing.
